Although often not reported, they have increasingly created disasters that have a ected the environment and socio-economic wellbeing of communities inhabiting these dry regions. is paper reports on the key invasives in the drylands of Kenya and Tanzania and their e ects, and suggests some disaster risk reduction (DRR) strategies. e study was largely based on secondary data analysis and supported by surveys in the a ected drylands. e ndings show ten key invasive plant species that a ect the drylands. eir disaster-e ects vary and include: causing the death of livestock by poisoning and destroying livestock foliage, accelerating biodiversity loss via suppression of native plants, to increasing diseases by o ering a breeding ground for mosquitoes and other insects that carry ailments like nagana and sleeping sickness.",
